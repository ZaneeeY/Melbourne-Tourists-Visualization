These thin alleys are filled with cafes, street-art, bars and buskers; they are brimming with charm and an essential visit for any tourist. Originally dingy service lanes (built to service local businesses and residents) Melbourne’s laneways were first revitalized in the 1980’s by the city council. This ushered in many small businesses and the beginning of a Melbourne icon. Melbourne’s most popular and commercial laneway is Hosier Lane, just down from Flinder’s Street Station. This laneway is bursting with street art from local artists, including a giant mural of a young Indigenous boy."

While it’s very easy to visit them all (and we suggest you do) our pick of the bunch is The Block Arcade. Modelled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan – it’s a pretty blatant copy – The Block Arcade features a giant domed roof, mosaic floor, and carved stone finishings. Why is it called ‘The Block Arcade’? From the 1860s to the 1930s, men and women would walk around this city block, dressed in their finest clothes in an attempt to be admired by others."
